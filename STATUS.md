**Overall: 11/11 pages exist (1 real, 10 placeholders)**

## Blocking Issues

### Network Access to srrn.net 🚫

**Problem:** The live site https://srrn.net is not accessible from the automated environment.

**Evidence:**
```
DNS: server can't find srrn.net: REFUSED
Ping: No address associated with hostname
```

**Impact:** Cannot download actual page content

**Solutions:**
1. Run scraper from environment with srrn.net access
2. Use Internet Archive if site is permanently down
3. Manual download via browser save-as

## Next Steps

### Immediate (When Network Available)

1. **Run Complete Scraping Workflow**
   ```bash
   pnpm run convert
   ```

2. **Verify Results**
   ```bash
   pnpm run verify
   # Should show 11/11 real content
   ```

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   pnpm run serve
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Commit and Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete scraping of all SRRN.net pages"
   git push
   ```

5. **Integrate External Services** (See [EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md](EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md))
   - Replace Training Calendar with Facebook Events widget or static HTML calendar
   - Add donation forms if needed (Zeffy recommended)
   - Set up analytics (Google Analytics)
   - Configure contact forms (Zeffy Forms or Microsoft Forms)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Set up automated scraping on schedule
- [ ] Add broken link checker
- [ ] Integrate external services per EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md

## External Services Required

After conversion, the following features need external service integration:

1. **Training Calendar** - Replace WordPress Modern Events Calendar with:
   - Static HTML calendar with links to external events (preferred - create/update by opening an issue and assigning to GitHub Copilot Pro Agent, or manually edit HTML files)
   - Facebook Events widget (alternative option, see template)

2. **Reference Template**: [FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML](https://github.com/FreeForCharity/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML)

See [EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md](EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md) for complete implementation guide.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Images display properly
